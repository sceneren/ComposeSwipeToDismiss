/**
 * Represents an action that can be shown in [SwipeAbleActionsBox].
 *
 * @param background Color used as the background of [SwipeAbleActionsBox] while
 * this action is visible. If this action is swiped, its background color is
 * also used for drawing a ripple over the content for providing a visual
 * feedback to the user.
 *
 * @param weight The proportional width to give to this element, as related
 * to the total of all weighted siblings. [SwipeAbleActionsBox] will divide its
 * horizontal space and distribute it to actions according to their weight.
 *
 * @param isUndo Determines the direction in which a ripple is drawn when this
 * action is swiped. When false, the ripple grows from this action's position
 * to consume the entire composable, and vice versa. This can be used for
 * actions that can be toggled on and off.
